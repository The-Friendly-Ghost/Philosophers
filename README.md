# Philosophers ðŸ§  
"In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes."

### Rules of the 'game':
- One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.
- The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.
- There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.
- Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.
- When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.
- Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
- Philosophers donâ€™t speak with each other.
- Philosophers donâ€™t know if another philosopher is about to die.
- No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!*

### Skills I've learned / improved
- Learned: working with threads.
- Learned: working with mutexes.
- Improved: optimizing code for better program performance.
- Improved: memory management and pointers.
